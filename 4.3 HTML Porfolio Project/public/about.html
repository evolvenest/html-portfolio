<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and curious 3rd-year engineering student with a strong interest in technology and development. 
  Over time, I’ve built a solid foundation in programming, beginning with Python and progressing through Data 
  Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using both Python and C++. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for
   understanding how systems work and how I can build practical, efficient solutions through code.</p>

<p>I recently completed a Python Development internship, which allowed me to apply my technical knowledge to 
  real-world projects. Currently, I’m expanding my skills into web development—learning HTML, CSS, and 
  JavaScript—to create responsive and user-friendly websites. I enjoy combining creativity with logic, and I
   believe in continuously learning to stay adaptable in an ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I am deeply committed to personal growth and self-improvement. I strive to stay consistent,
   focused, and intentional with my time. Whether it’s mastering new skills or tackling challenges, I approach life
    with a mindset of growth, reflection, and purpose. I’m someone who values progress, embraces responsibility,
     and is always working toward becoming a better version of myself.</p>
